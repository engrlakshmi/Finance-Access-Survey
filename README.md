# Finance-Access-Survey
The project focused on Mobile money as a financial service that leverages the widespread use of mobile phones to facilitate various financial transactions, such as payments, transfers, and access to banking services. This technology has transformed the way people handle money in many parts of the world, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking infrastructure.
With mobile money, users can securely store, send, and receive funds using their mobile phones, reducing the need for physical cash and expanding financial inclusion for millions of people. This accessible and convenient system has made it easier for individuals to manage their finances, pay bills, and even access credit, thereby promoting financial inclusion and economic development in underserved communities.
